### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hyunjun Jeon, a specially data engineering and product engineer. 
I loves many things.

I have been working at companies in the financial domain,
I am in charge of data engineering (Hadoop, Hive, Impala, Kubernetes, Trino, ETL, Python, Spark).
Other skills include Backend (Java-Spring, Python-FastAPI, and Langchain for LLM controls) for creating products
Frontend (React, Next.js), and more.

I'm mainly curious about the problem of information asymmetry in the FINANCIAL issues, and I'm thinking about AI as a means to make good decisions based on information.
I work with the principle that no matter how the world changes, the basics remain the same.
